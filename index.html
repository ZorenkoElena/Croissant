				Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
				crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using brioche dough.
				Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and
				p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
				century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
				with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the
				development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made
				them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor.
				The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
				response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the
				croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
				frozen dough.
